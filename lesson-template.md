You can start writing your lesson immediately after the front matter. The title will automatically generate for you from the front matter, so there is no need to include an additional title.

# If you use a section header, it will autopopulate into the Table of contents

This is a useful feature!

## This is also true of subheadings, so go nuts

This website supports normal Markdown features, so you can include [links](https://dh-tech.github.io) and ![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dh-tech/wg-education-training/refs/heads/website/static/images/hippocoding4.png). If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, we recommend you use the following markdown tutorial:
