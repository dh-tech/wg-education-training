Abstract:
This paper outlines an in-progress educational resource created by the DHTech Education
and Training Working Group. The preliminary resource seeks to fill a gap in the current
training materials available to people who work on the technical side of Digital Humanities
projects. It will provide resources on high-level core concepts of software development that
contextualize, rather than duplicate, existing resources. The contribution outlines the intended
workflow for producing this resource and details the anticipated challenges and barriers to
implementation.
