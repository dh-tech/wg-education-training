The members of the DH Education and Training Working Group published a [paper outlining our planned goals and activites](https://anthology.ach.org/volumes/vol0002/developing-training-education-resources-for-in-dh/) in the proceedings from the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium 2025! These conference proceedings were published in the [*Anthology of Computers and the Humanities*](https://anthology.ach.org/volumes/vol0002/) and stem from a mini-conference held during DH2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.

Abstract:  
This paper outlines an in-progress educational resource created by the DHTech Education and Training Working Group. The preliminary resource seeks to fill a gap in the current training materials available to people who work on the technical side of Digital Humanities projects. It will provide resources on high-level core concepts of software development that contextualize, rather than duplicate, existing resources. The contribution outlines the intended workflow for producing this resource and details the anticipated challenges and barriers to implementation.
