# Reviewing Guidelines

Thanks for joining our community of reviewers!

This page gives you a quick overview of what to expect when reviewing lessons and how you can help improve them before they’re published.

- **Purpose and scope of the review**  
  Your role is to help make sure the post makes sense and is easy to follow. Check whether the content is relevant and accurate, that links work, and that nothing important is missing. If something could be clearer or better explained, let us know.

- **Format of reviews**  
  Feedback is usually given as comments or suggestions on a submitted text.

- **Volume of requests**  
  You’ll be contacted only when there’s a post relevant to your interests and expertise. There’s no obligation to review every time.

- **Acknowledgment**  
  Reviewers will be credited in the published post.
